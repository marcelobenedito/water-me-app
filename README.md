Water Me! app
=======================================

This repository contains the code for the Water Me! app project.

The app currently displays a list of plants in a scrolling list. When you tap on a plant, the app lets you set a reminder to water the plant.

It's developed using Jetpack Compose components like ```Column```, ```Button```, ```Text```, ```Image```, and ```Modifier```.
